### Comments

This was a challenging little app for me to put together! Most of the technology was completely new to me just a few days ago. This was my first React web app, as well as my first time using ES6 and JSX syntax.

I would liked to have spent more time styling. After reading/watching many React talks and tutorials, the idea of in-line styling and how it fits with React has piqued my interest! It's definitely something I will continue reading about.

I had an attempt with Angular 2 previous to this app. Being significantly different to Angular 1 in my personal experience, it was a bit too much to take on completely fresh. I'm very happy to have gone with React, I find it much more intuitive and 'easier' to use and understand while also being enjoyable to work with.
